.SH NAME
.
search-in-subs \- search for words in subtitle files
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.
.SY search-in-subs
[<options>] -t <search_term> ... [<file|dir> ...]
.YS
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBsearch-in-subs\fR allows the user to search for text in SRT subtitle files.
.P
At least one search term must be specified to run a search (see \%\fB-t,\ --search-term\fR). If no \%<file|dir> argument is given, a glob pattern set with the \%\fBconf_default_glob\fR option is used to match subtitle files. If a \%<file|dir> argument is a directory, files matching the default glob pattern in that directory are added to the search.
.P
The default value of \%\fBconf_default_glob\fR is \%'*.srt', which matches all files with the '.srt' extension in the current working directory. That value can be changed to any other glob pattern in the configuration file (see CONFIGURATION and FILES below).
.P
Shell options \%'nullglob', \%'extglob' and \%'globstar' are enabled internally in \%\fBsearch-in-subs\fR, so shell globbing can be used to its full capacity when setting \%\fBconf_default_glob\fR. For example, to match all \%'.srt' files in the current working directory recursively, including all of its subdirectories, one could set \%\fBconf_default_glob\fR to \%'**/*.srt'.
.P
\%\fBsearch-in-subs\fR can also gather statistics on searches that it runs. Try running a search with the \%\fB-s,\ --stats\fR option set. For more information, see STATISTICS below.
.
.SS mpv EDL generation
.P
\%\fBsearch-in-subs\fR can generate EDL files for \%\fBmpv\fR player, and play the search results using it. To use this functionality, \%\fBmpv\fR, \%\fBffmpeg\fR and \%\fBlua\fR\ (v5.4) must be installed and available on system's PATH.
.P
In order to generate the EDL files, a video or audio file must exist in the same directory as the subtitle file(s) on which the search is performed. The video or audio file must have the same name as the subtitle file, minus the \%'.srt' extension, and potentially additional extensions containing language codes or other information, e.g. \%'.en.srt'. Any number of additional extensions is allowed. If both video and audio files are found, video files take precedence. If multiple video or audio files are found, the first one will be chosen for use in the generated EDL files.
.P
See \%\fB--edl-*\fR options below for more information.
.P
More information on mpv EDL format can be found at \%<https://github.com/\:mpv-player/\:mpv/\:blob/\:master/\:DOCS/\:edl-mpv.rst>.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.SS Passing arguments to options
.P
Enhanced \%\fBgetopt\fR syntax applies when passing options. There is one important point to highlight when it comes to passing options with required vs optional arguments.
.P
In case of a short option, if an option takes a \fIrequired\fR argument, the argument may be written as a separate parameter, \fIor\fR directly after the option character. If an option takes an \fIoptional\fR argument, however, the argument \fImust\fR be written directly after the option character.
.P
In case of a long option, if an option takes a \fIrequired\fR argument, the argument may be written as a separate parameter, \fIor\fR directly after the option name, separated by an equals sign \%('='). If an option takes an \fIoptional\fR argument, however, the argument \fImust\fR be written directly after the option name, separated by an equals sign \%('=').

.TP
.B \%-t,\ --search-term\fR=<search_term>
Text to search for. Can be a fixed string or a regular expression depending on the \%\fB-r,\ --regex\fR\ / \%\fB-R,\ --no-regex\fR options.
.
.sp
At least one search term must be given to perform a search. Setting this option multiple times sets multiple search terms.
.

.
.SS mpv EDL generation
.
.TP
.B \%-p,\ --edl-play
Play search results in \%\fBmpv\fR.
.sp
Unless \%\fB-f,\ --edl-save-files-relative\fR or \%\fB-F,\ --edl-save-files-absolute\fR is used together with this option, temporary EDL files are generated and saved in the cache directory (see FILES for more information). The \%\fB-k,\ --edl-keep-temporary\fR and \%\fB-K,\ --edl-no-keep-temporary\fR options control whether or the temporary EDL files are deleted or kept after \%\fBmpv\fR player closes.
.sp
If \%\fB-f,\ --edl-save-files-relative\fR or \%\fB-F,\ --edl-save-files-absolute\fR is used together with \%\fB-p,\ --edl-play\fR, then temporary files are not generated and the saved EDL files are played.
.
.TP
.B \%-P,\ --edl-no-play
Do not play search results in \%\fBmpv\fR. This is the default.
.
.TP
.B \%-k,\ --edl-play-keep-temporary
Keep temporary EDL files that are created to play search results in \%\fBmpv\fR.
.
.TP
.B \%-K,\ --edl-play-no-keep-temporary
Do not keep temporary EDL files that are created to play search results in \%\fBmpv\fR. This is the default.
.sp
The temporary files are deleted right after \%\fBmpv\fR player closes.
.
.TP
.B \%-b,\ --edl-play-before\fR=<value>
Add a specified amount of time before each segment when generating EDL files. \%<value> is in seconds. Precise values with a decimal separator are allowed. The default \%<value> is 0.
.
.TP
.B \%-a,\ --edl-play-after\fR=<value>
Add a specified amount of time after each segment when generating EDL files. \%<value> is in seconds. Precise values with a decimal separator are allowed. The default \%<value> is 0.
.
.TP
.B \%-f,\ --edl-save\fR[={<path>[/]|<path>/<name>.edl|<name>.edl}]
Save EDL files to a specified location instead of generating temporary ones.
.sp
If \%<path> is not given, the EDL files are saved to the current working directory. If \%<name> is not given, the name set by \%\fBconf_edl_default_name\fR will be used.
.sp
A '.edl' extension after \%<name> is required because it serves to distinguish a directory called \%"<name>" from a name of an EDL file. To save to a directory whose name ends in \%'.edl' (without specifying \%"<name>.edl"), add a trailing forward slash \%('/') after \%<path>.
.
.TP
.B \%-F,\ --edl-no-save
Do not save EDL files, but generate temporary files instead. This is the default.
.
.TP
.B \%--edl-save-paths\fR=<value>
What kind of paths to use in saved EDL files to refer to source files.
.
.RS
.TP
relative
Use relative paths. This is the default.
.TP
absolute
Use absolute paths.
.RE
.
.TP
.B \%-d,\ --edl-save-mkdir
Create the EDL save directory (the \%<path> value of \%\fB--edl-save-files-*\fR options) if it does not exist.
.
.TP
.B \%-D,\ --edl-save-no-mkdir
Do not create the EDL save directory (the \%<path> value of \%\fB--edl-save-files-*\fR options) if it does not exist. This is the default.
.
.TP
.B \%-y,\ --edl-save-overwrite
Allow overwriting existing files when saving EDL files.
.
.TP
.B \%-Y,\ --edl-save-no-overwrite
Do not allow overwriting existing files when saving EDL files. This is the default.
.
.TP
.B \%-o,\ --edl-ignore-missing
Omit segments with missing videos when generating EDL files. This is the default.
.sp
If set, a warning message is shown listing subtitle files for which no corresponding video file could be identified, but EDL files are still generated if at least one relevant video file was able to be found.
.
.TP
.B \%-O,\ --edl-no-ignore-missing
Do not omit segments with missing videos when generating EDL files.
.sp
If set, an error message is shown listing subtitle files for which no corresponding video file could be identified, In this case, no EDL files are generated, and \fBsearch-in-subs\fR exits with exit status 3.
.
.TP
.B \%-u,\ --edl-structure\fR=<value>
Determines the structure of the set of generated EDL files. \%<value> can be \%'flat', \%'subdir', \%'subdir_hidden', \%'subdir_except_chapters' or \%'subdir_hidden_except_chapters'. The default \%<value> is \%'flat'.
.
.TP
.B \%--mpv-opts\fR=[:[:]]<opts>
Options to \%\fBmpv\fR player.
.sp
\%<opts> is an option string that follows \%\fBxargs\fR quoting. It can be preceded by a single colon, double colon, or nothing.
.sp
The leading colons control whether \%<opts> get appended to previously set options, or replace them.
.sp
The phrase 'previously set options' refers to either the default value of \%<opts> set by \fBsearch-in-subs\fR itself \%(''), or a value set in the configuration file.
.sp
When a single colon \%(':') is used, \%<opts> replace the previously set options.
.sp
When a double colon \%('::') is used, \%<opts> are appended to the previously set options.
.sp
When the leading colons are omitted, whether \%<opts> replace the previously set options, or are appended to them is determined by an *additonal* value that is yet again set either by \fBsearch-in-subs\fR itself (append), or in the configuration file.
.sp
The name of the variable that controls this has the following format: \%\fBoptdata__<opt_name>__<optdata_name>\fR where \%<opt_name> is the name of the option, and \%<optdata_name> is the name of the piece of option data that the variable holds. In this case \%<optdata_name> is \%'append'. So if the option's variable is called \%\fBopt_mpv_opts\fR, then the variable that controls what happens when the leading colons are omitted is called \%\fBoptdata__mpv_opts__append\fR.

.TP
.B \%conf_default_glob
A shell glob pattern to use when no \%<file|dir> arguments are specified, or when a \%<file|dir> argument is a directory. The default is \%'*.srt'.
.sp
Shell options \%'nullglob', \%'extglob' and \%'globstar' are enabled internally in \%\fBsearch-in-subs\fR, thus the default glob pattern is sensitive to those options.  
.
.TP
.B \%conf_edl_default_name
The default name for a generated EDL file. The default value is \%'search_results'.
.
.TP
.B \%conf_chapter_title
A generated EDL's chapter title. The value is a string with placeholders. See also PLACEHOLDER FORMAT.
.sp
If set to an empty string (''), the result is equivalent to using the value of '%{text_abbr}', but with a slight performance increase. The default value is ''.
.sp
The following placeholders are supported:
.

EDL generation failed. Can only occur if \%\fB-O,\ --edl-no-ignore-missing\fR is set.
.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.P
The values of \%\fBVISUAL\fR and \%\fBEDITOR\fR environment variables determine the text editor when opening configuration files with \%\fB--config\fR.
.P
\%\fBVISUAL\fR is evaluated first. If that is not set, then \%\fBEDITOR\fR is evaluated. If neither is set, \%\fBnano\fR is used as the text editor.
.
.SH FILES
.P
A configuration file can be used to change the default behavior of \%\fBsearch-in-subs\fR.
.P
The configuration file's location is \%"$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/\:search-in-subs/\:config.bash". If \%"XDG_CONFIG_HOME" is not set, it defaults to \%"$HOME/\:.config".
.P
Temporary EDL files that are generated when using the \%\fB-p,\ --edl-play\fR option are stored in a cache directory.
.P
The cache directory's location is \%"$XDG_CACHE_HOME/\:search-in-subs". If \%"XDG_CACHE_HOME" is not set, it defaults to \%"$HOME/\:.cache".
.
.SH STATISTICS
.P
If the \%\fB-s,\ --stats\fR option is enabled, \%\fBsearch-in-subs\fR gathers statistics on the search that it performs and displays those statistics in a table at the end of the output.
.P
The 'Matched', 'Total', 'Unmatched' and 'Matched\ %' columns of that table contain the following data:
